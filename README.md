# 🔍 Searching and Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web-based tool to visualize fundamental searching and sorting algorithms like **Linear Search**, **Binary Search**, **Bubble Sort**, and **Selection Sort**. This project helps you understand the inner workings of these algorithms by visually demonstrating each step.

## 🌟 Features
- 🎯 **Search Algorithms**: Visualize how Linear and Binary Search work in real-time.
- 🚀 **Sort Algorithms**: Watch the sorting process for Bubble and Selection Sort with step-by-step animations.
- 💻 **Built with**:
  - **HTML5** & **CSS3** for layout and design.
  - **JavaScript** for dynamic algorithm visualization.
  - **Tailwind CSS** for clean, responsive design.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **index.html**: The home page for algorithm selection.
- **searching/**: Code for searching algorithms visualization.
- **sorting/**: Code for sorting algorithms visualization.

## 🚀 Getting Started
